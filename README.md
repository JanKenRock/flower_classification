# flower_classification

**Abstract** *We train the pretrained ResNet50 model on a dataset consisting of images of classes of flowers. Given an image of an arbitrary flower from any of these classes, the resulting model will be able to predict - with a certain accuracy - which exact class the flower belongs to.*
